Giuseppe Cammarota
==================

I am a Telecommunication Engineer with experience in space-borne and air-borne remote sensed data analysis, hyper-spectral data, SAR data and algorithms development.

Previosly I worked at [e-GEOS][a] as SAR Data Specialist. 

In 2014 I joined [B-Open][0] where I currently serve as Senior Scientific Software Engineer enjoying geospatial climate and satellite data analysis and processing with Python.

I have developed a strong knowledge of scientific and numerical Python libraries like Xarray, Numpy and Scipy. I also have gained experience in the manipulation of data formats such as NetCDF and GRIB.

I have contributed to the design, the development and the maintenance of the [Climate Data Store Toolbox][b] and also trained and supported its early users.

I am currently involved in the development of the [EUMETSAT Data Tailor][c].
