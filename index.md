Giuseppe Cammarota
==================

I am an Earth observation specialist and software engineer with experience in space-borne and air-borne remote sensed data analysis, hyper-spectral data, SAR data and algorithms development.

I worked at [e-GEOS][a] as SAR Data Specialist from 2011 to 2014.

In 2014 I have joined [B-Open][0] where I currently serve as Earth observation specialist and senior scientific software engineer enjoying climate and satellite geospatial data analysis and processing with Python.

I have developed a strong knowledge of scientific and numerical Python libraries like Xarray, Numpy and Scipy. I have gained proficiency in the manipulation of data formats such as NetCDF and GRIB.

I also have gained major experience with platforms as Docker and Kubernetes, and acquired strong knowledge of CI/CD practices, mainly implemented using GitLab pipelines.

I have contributed to the design, the development and the maintenance of the [Climate Data Store Toolbox][b] and also trained and supported its early users.

Among other things, I am currently involved in the development of the [EUMETSAT Data Tailor][c].
